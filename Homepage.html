	Professor Jason Bantjes (right), a researcher specialising in mental health and injury at the SAMRC – 
	said the initiative was stimulated by the need to do something about student mental health,
	to try and quantify the extent of the problem and identify potential points of intervention.
	<br>
	According to the Professor the anonymous online survey was designed to assess undergraduate student support needs, 
	their history of psycho-social problems, predisposition to mental health risk and protective factors.
	“The survey also measured exposure to trauma, food insecurity and gender-based violence on university campuses. 
	It also assessed students’ preferences for and attitudes towards psychosocial services and interventions,
	” he explained.Although  all 26 publicly funded South African universities were invited to participate, 
	in the end only 19 took part, with a total of 29 000 students fully completing the survey
	“It is inaccurate to position all students as ‘patients in need of therapy’ – doing so contributes to an 
	unhelpful narrative of positioning all students as ‘diminished’ and ‘vulnerable’. 
	
	<br>
	A small group of students (about four percent) require specialised clinical services.
	A larger group of students with fair mental health (around 14 percent) require low-intensity psychosocial support.
	Strategies to support students with poor mental health are different from those needed to help students with fair mental health. 
	Not all students are in the same place when it comes to their mental health,” he explained.
<br>
“Rates of major depressive disorder was about 15.4 percent, generalised anxiety disorder about 10.9 percent, 
panic disorder at 7.2 and bipolar spectrum disorder at 1.8. 
The 30 day prevalence of other mental health problems were attention difficulties (21 percent), 
drug abuse (5.1 percent), 
alcohol dependence (2.5 percent) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), (21 percent).

<br>
Students’ age, university type and sexual orientation seem to be factors in anxiety disorder 
He emphasised that the social political history of South Africa created an educational landscape
 with different types of universities ranging from historically white institutions 
(HWI) to historically disadvantaged institutions (HDI) and distance learning universities.
<br>
“The prevalence rates of  anxiety disorders are consistently higher at historically white institutions
 with these students reporting much higher levels of distress.
 Unisa has the lowest proportion of individuals who would meet a criteria for a psychiatric disorder. 
 That makes sense given that a large number of students at Unisa are over the age of 35. 
 At historically white institutions,there are a lot of students who are under the age of 19. 
 Younger students experience higher levels of psychological distress, 
 probably because they are adjusting to university. However, those with psychological symptoms are likely to drop out of university during their undergraduate years. 
 So by the time we sample students who are aged 20 to 23, the ones with mental illness have already been lost to the system. And so you see declining rates of psychological distress in older students.”
<br>

Furthermore, black African students, and those who identified as Asian or 
coloured who attended historically white institutions, 
were at higher risk of mental illness compared to white students:
 “I think that’s something perhaps 
 about the culture of these institutions and about levels of alienation and marginalisation. 
 The survey doesn’t provide insight into exactly 
 why we’re seeing this higher risk but it does flag it for us as something that requires more investigation.”

<br>

Professor Bantjes said psychological disorders were also elevated among gender non-conforming students; 
sexual minorities in relation to heterosexual students and those with lower parental education.
 However, he emphasised that these were moderate risk factors.

<br>

Students presented with mental distress even prior to CoVID-19
“We had data from pre-CoVID pilots
 which were done at the University of Cape Town and at Stellenbosch 
University in 2015 and 2017,” Professor Bantjes mentioned.

<br>

 “There were no significant differences in increased prevalence for a major depressive episode,
 generalised anxiety disorder or suicidal ideation between 2017 and 2020.
 However, the rates of psychological distress among first year students at 
 UCT were already high in 2017.
 This was hot on the heels of things like Fees Must Fall
 which had significantly disrupted university campuses in 2017.
 What this highlights is that while CoVID was distressing
 and disruptive for universities, students were experiencing distress before then. Rates 
 of mental illness among students were already steadily increasing from 2015,” he said.

<br>
Some students show symptoms prior to university enrolment
He further said the age of onset for many mental health disorders is between
 16 and 18 with the symptoms either starting
 before students enter university or emerging during the first year.

<br>
“We can’t begin to talk about the mental health 
of university students without talking about the mental health of high school students. 
What we find between 2015, 2017 and 2020 is that 
more students were arriving at university with pre-existing conditions.
 It may be possible to screen students on registration or early in their in their first year for those with histories
 of psychiatric conditions and target them for particular interventions.”
He emphasised that the screening would be done sensitively. 

<br>
“In Belgium, for example, on registration, students are prompted to do a mental health survey and they’re given feedback immediately.
 They can opt out immediately or receive information on services that may help them. 
 There is no stigma and no profiling.”
<br>

In this world, wherever there is light.There are also shadows,As long as the concept of winners exist, there must be losers.
<br>
He said this called for a review of traditional treatment models. 
 For example, one-on-one therapy is not always a sustainable or feasible solution.
 Aside from depression and anxiety, other issues such as post-traumatic stress disorders (PTSD), 
 attention difficulties and substance abuse also have to be focused on.

<br>
Another finding was that suicidal behaviour is high — with 8.6 percent of students saying that
 they made a suicide plan and 2.3 percent admitting they had made a suicide attempt.
 “These are significantly higher than we would observe in the general population,
 ” said Professor Bantjes, 
 
 
 also emphasising that it is not altogether unusual for young adults to think about life and death.

For why students do not access psychological services, Professor Bantjes cited reasons including:
<br>

Limited access to affordable services
Reluctance to receive help from professionals
The stigma surrounding mental health and perceptions of therapy’s ineffectiveness
Time and financial constraints
Not realising that support is needed

	<h2>Financial aiding<h2>
	
	<p2>All students meet financial issues due lack of bursaries due to earlier 
	rejection by nsfas, however, also lack of businesses supporting students 
	in University to pull through. Research, states that most universities
	support on average of more than two thirds of their unirestricted  revenue. 
	Student fee component in university budget is typically in the region of 
	30-40%, approach to  30 billion rands per annium, including the residential 
	fees.
